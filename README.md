This course has helped me to understand the logical structure of front end development much better. I’ve gotten to a point where I understand the role of Routers, Controllers and Models which is a big development given that I found the concept rather overwhelming at first! Going through the express material I was able to get a grasp on how the MVC works and appreciate its utility. I can definitely see the value of creating components in angular, however for this project since we didn’t focus too much on the css, we weren’t able to take advantage of Angular’s ability to have one page with many components styled very differently. We used MongoDB for this project which has the big advantage of storing JSON like objects.
